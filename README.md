# left_handedness_hormones
The code for my project on whether left and mixed handers have different Oestradiol and Testosterone levels to right handers

The project uses publicly available health data from the US National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 
The data cleaning script contains code the download the NHANES data directly from the CDC website, but I have also provided the data if you don't want to do that.

The cleaning script downloads, pulls together and cleans the data for analysis. It uses data from multiple years and multiple datafiles for the same year so that's why there's multiple datafiles. The analysis script loads them all in and...analyses them!
